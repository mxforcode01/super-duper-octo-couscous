Great catch. You can make derailments a non-issue with a two-layer defense:

Backend intent gate (cheap & fast) — detect if the user’s chat instruction is about the current RFP question (rephrase/expand) vs off-topic.

In-prompt guardrails — even if something slips through, the LLM must refuse to change the answer and surface a clear “off-topic” notice.

Below is everything you need.

1) System message (with derailment guardrails)

Use this for the Chat with AI side panel:

You are an expert RFP proposal writer and research assistant.
Your job is to revise or expand the answer for the CURRENT RFP QUESTION ONLY.

Intent rules

If the user instruction is rephrasing-only (e.g., “shorter,” “more persuasive,” “formal tone”): ignore context; rephrase the current draft.

If the user instruction requests more information (e.g., “add regulatory details,” “include global coverage”): use the retrieved context provided.

If the user instruction is off-topic (not about the current RFP question or its draft), do not answer the off-topic query and do not change the draft. Instead, return an Off-Topic Notice as specified below.

Output format (must include these sections every time):

### Revised Answer
<the new/unchanged draft here>

### What Changed
- <bullets describing edits or “No changes made (instruction unrelated).”>

### Notice (Only if off-topic)
<one sentence: why it’s off-topic + offer: “Switch context or start a new chat?”>


Do not invent facts. Never answer questions unrelated to the current RFP question in this panel.

2) Prompt message

Question:

{{question_text}}


Current Draft Answer:

{{current_answer}}


User Instruction:

{{user_instruction}}


Retrieved Context (optional; may be empty):

{{retrieved_context}}


Follow the System Message. Produce the three sections exactly as specified.

3) Lightweight backend intent gate (so you don’t even send context when not needed)

Use a tiny rule-based classifier before you call the LLM. It’s fast and avoids sending retrieval context for rephrase-only edits.

import re

REPHRASE_HINTS = r"(rephrase|rewrite|polish|tone|shorter|concise|clearer|simplify|formal|persuasive|impactful|tighten|grammar|flow)"
EXPAND_HINTS   = r"(add|expand|include|more detail|evidence|examples|data|metrics|cite|reference|source|regulator|coverage|capability)"
OFFTOPIC_CLUES = r"(weather|movie|stock price|personal advice|unrelated|not about this question)"

def classify_intent(user_instruction: str, question_text: str) -> str:
    ui = user_instruction.lower()

    # basic off-topic screen: if it references nothing about the question keywords and looks generic
    q_keywords = set(re.findall(r"[a-zA-Z]{4,}", question_text.lower()))
    overlap = sum(1 for w in re.findall(r"[a-zA-Z]{4,}", ui) if w in q_keywords)

    if re.search(OFFTOPIC_CLUES, ui) or overlap == 0 and not re.search(EXPAND_HINTS, ui) and not re.search(REPHRASE_HINTS, ui):
        return "off_topic"

    if re.search(REPHRASE_HINTS, ui) and not re.search(EXPAND_HINTS, ui):
        return "rephrase"

    if re.search(EXPAND_HINTS, ui):
        return "expand"

    # default to rephrase (safer/cheaper)
    return "rephrase"


Routing logic:

rephrase → Call LLM without retrieved context (save tokens).

expand → Run RAG, pass retrieved_context to the prompt.

off_topic → Option A: don’t call LLM; immediately return a canned response in your required format:

### Revised Answer
{{current_answer}}  # unchanged

### What Changed
- No changes made (instruction unrelated to this question).

### Notice (Only if off-topic)
Your request seems unrelated to this RFP question. Switch context or start a new chat?


Option B: still call LLM (it will output the same shape due to system guardrails).

4) UX tips to prevent confusion

Show the current question title pinned at the top of the chat panel (“Editing: Q12 – Data Security & Compliance”).

If off_topic, render two quick actions: [Switch Question] and [Start New Chat].

When intent = rephrase, label the panel “Rephrase mode”; when intent = expand, label “Research mode”.

5) Testing checklist

Rephrase-only prompts (“shorter”, “more persuasive”) → no context sent; LLM ignores any residual retrieved_context.

Expand prompts (“add MAS compliance details”) → context sent; “What Changed” lists added facts with brief provenance if you wish (“added MAS TRM mention”).

Off-topic (“What’s the weather”) → draft unchanged + Off-Topic Notice.

This combo (backend intent gate + strict system rules + fixed output sections) keeps the model from mixing the user’s side-chat with the actual RFP question, while giving users a smooth way to redirect if they truly meant to change context.
